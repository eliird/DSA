package main

//Cyclic Graph Can visit three nodes and come back
//acyclic no cycle in the graphs
//Directed and Undirected

//DAG directed and acyclic

//node is vertex of the graph
//edge is the connection between the nodes

//Represent in two ways
//Adj List
//Adj matrix  Takes a lot of memory and setting up so is not common in practice O(V**2) especially in sparsely connected

//Adj List Would be same as linked list
//Each node will contain all the items that can be traversed from that node as tuple
//You know how to represent adjacency matrix
